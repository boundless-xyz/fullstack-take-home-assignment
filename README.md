# Boundless - Fullstack Take-Home Assignment

Your task is to build a cryptocurrency market data dashboard that reproduces the provided screenshot using Next.js (mandatory). 

The application should demonstrate proficiency in server-side rendering, client-side interactivity, and production readiness.

Feel free to use any library you see fit, as long as you can justify their use.

_For this assignment, you just need to build the page for Ethereum (ETH)._

### Core Functionality

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Initial data should be rendered using Next.js App Router server components
2. **Client-Side Updates**: Once loaded, the data should refresh automatically every 30 seconds
3. **Responsive Design**: The interface should work well on both desktop and mobile devices
4. **Modern Tech Stack**: Use up-to-date technologies suitable for production development

### Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Complete Next.js project with all source files
2. **Live Demo**: Deploy the application anywhere you want for us to take a look

### Bonus Points
